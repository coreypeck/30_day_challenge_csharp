Using an online course for Unity, I downloaded Unity 5, Blender, Audacity, and MonoDevelop

This is in anticipation for using C# to learn game making basics in 2D and 3D environments

1: I learned how similar C# is to JS and I learned about print(console.log) and if/else if statements.

2: I ran out of time toward the end of the day. I didn't have time to work on my C# and, even though I had committed something else today, I thought I'd at least get in the habit
