Using an online course for Unity, I downloaded Unity 5, Blender, Audacity, and MonoDevelop

This is in anticipation for using C# to learn game making basics in 2D and 3D environments

1: I learned how similar C# is to JS and I learned about print(console.log) and if/else if statements.

2: I ran out of time toward the end of the day. I didn't have time to work on my C# and, even though I had committed something else today, I thought I'd at least get in the habit

3: Worked on some C# function abstraction today. Still, very similar to JS, expect I have to keep in mind that you need to specify the type/what it returns. For instance, Void returns nothing

4-5-6...I haven't had a lot of time to work on my C#. I tomorrow I will be able to get an actual commit in.

Today I revisited the beginning lessons, I wanted to make sure that I was able to get back into it, turns out I shouldn't have been so worried. I hadn't gotten all that far to start with.

I didn't have time to work on my commit today, but tomorrow I will!
